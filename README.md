# Locally Provioned Kuberetes Cluster with Anisble and Vagrant

This is an inteded demonstration of what can be done to quickly provision a local development environment utilizing the following tools:

1. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
3. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

The goal of this lab is to encourage experimentation on a small Kubernbetes environment and enable users to rapidly iterate on tasks and ideas without worring about long setup times or external provisioning dependencies.
